		Being a forestry based company, CMPC Celulose Riograndense is fully aware that the survival of its enterprise is directly linked to the renewable use of natural resources, guaranteeing their availability for future generations.
		<br><br>
		Its forestry and industrial activities are guided by a consummate concept of sustainability. The renewable eucalyptus plantations – the only raw material source used by the cellulose pulp mill – are the best example of this conduct.

	<h3>Environmental Monitoring</h3>

	<div>
		<strong>Flora</strong><br>
		Native vegetation types existing in the company area are mapped and fragments in initial regeneration stage are characterized at the field in order to define recovery measures. As the planting is distributed in different biomes, characterization studies for monitoring phytosociological dynamics are conducted in two large blocks - one related to vegetation with forestal size and the other related do campestral vegetation.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Fauna</strong><br>
		The company faunal surveys are basically focused on birds, considering the various existing ecosystem types. The avifauna is the bioindicator group used by the company to monitor the impacts of forestal management activities on the biodiversity of its actuation areas. Gradually, other groups such as mammals, reptiles, and amphibians will be also studied to make possible the improvement in conservation actions.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Hydric Resources</strong><br>
		Water quality and quantity are monitored in a network of microbasins characterizing the different regions where the company actuates in. A network of specific equipment (piezometers) was installed to monitor the depth of water tables and the quality of subsuperficial water. 		<br><br>
		<strong>Use of Birds as Bioindicators</strong><br>
		Bird behavior works as a biodiversity thermometer in the plantings of Celulose Riograndense, once they are very sensitive and are the first to go away at any unbalance sign. In its state monitoring, the company has already identified more than 200 bird species in its areas. Birds frequent native vegetation fragments alternated among eucalyptus plantings, besides the very eucalyptus.
