		Silvicultural activity is a direct generator of municipal tolls. ISSQN collection occurs along the productive cycle, especially in planting and harvest phases, besides the direct generation of municipal tolls; it is indirectly subject for payment of social security contributions (PIS/COFINS), when any operation is performed in the company areas. Furthermore, an additional municipal toll is generated in the time of selling, always when the company decides to purchase land for planting: ITBI (Tax on Transference of Real Estates). It is significant to underline that there will be ISSQN collection again always when operations occur in the area (for example, road maintenance, fences, planting measures/forestal inventory, or operations for environmental recovery) in the interval between these events. However, the generation from these operations is lower compared to that obtained in implantation and harvest phases.

		In the year 2015, Celulose Riograndense (CMPC) generated an ISSQN collection of R$ 2,742,739.66 (nominal values) in the monitored municipalities.
