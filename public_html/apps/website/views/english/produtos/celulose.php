	<h3 class="header" id="o-que-e">What is cellulose?</h2>

	<div class="descricao">
		Cellulose is a polysaccharide (similar to sugar) that is the main component of the cell wall of plant fibers. Together with lignin, resins, and minerals (inorganic compounds), cellulose is one of the compounds that constitute wood - about 50%. Its molecules, grouped by lignin, form fiber bundles that constitute the vegetal cells that compose the fibers present in wood. (Schedule figure 02) 
		<br><br>
		The aim of the industrial process is to extract cellulose from wood as a paste, separating it from lignin, resins, and minerals, which are used for generating electric energy by the very factory.

	<div class="fluxograma">
		Know the cellulose production flowchart and uncover each step of our extensive work. Approximately 7  years elapse to perform it, from research and planting of eucalyptus seedlings up to the fiber being transformed in the paper that will be in people homes around the world.

				This happens in the planting where eucalyptuses are cultured. The process happens in three steps: harvest, cutting, and peeling. Bark, leaves, and branches stay on the soil to become organic matter.

				After this process, logs are taken to washing, picking to predetermined size, and sieving. From this point, the chips are deposited in silos.

				In cooking, chips form a brown paste, also called non-bleached cellulose. This process, called Kraft, occurs at 150ºC, with addition of sodium sulfate and caustic soda, dissolving lignin and releasing cellulose as a higher quality paper pulp.
			</li>
			<li>
				<img alt="" src="<?=base_url('assets/img/'.getLang().'/fluxograma-4.jpg'); ?>">
				Refinement is the separation of impurities from wood and of chip pieces that were not cooked. Then lignin (a substance that links cellulose cells) is removed. In bleaching, cellulose is sieved to remove impurities, and its properties (whiteness, cleanliness, and chemical purity) are improved.

				In drying, cellulose water is removed up to reaching a satisfactory balance with the environmental relative humidity.

				Next phase, when a cutter reduces the continuous sheet to other smaller ones. These sheets form 250-kg cellulose bales.

				After being stored, cellulose is sent through Guaíba Lake and Patos Lagoon to Rio Grande harbor, where it is embarked to the consumer market. One of the differences of Celulose Riograndense is presenting a location close to BR 290 and a proper harbor, facilitating the shipping to the most varied regions.

				Cellulose produced in Guaíba factory is used for external market, especially for the Asian continent.

				Celulose Riograndense is the greatest Gaúcho manufacturer of eucalyptus short fiber bleached cellulose, a raw material pivotal for obtaining printing and writing paper and paper for hygiene and cleaning.
